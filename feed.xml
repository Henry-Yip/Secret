&lt;p&gt;Those who know me know I struggled during the semester due to insane workload (Mon to Sun Morning to Night without 1 min of break). I spent the first week just absolutely being lost (waking up at 1pm, going out to eat a meal then sleeping at 4am, eating two cup noodles because I’m hungry at 3am)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;second-week&quot;&gt;Second Week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ljubljana_Castle&quot;&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt; then &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split,_Croatia&quot;&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;, had a fabalous time :) (thanks if you went with me), honestly one of the best memories in 2022 and very possibly in 2023… (:/)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kinder.com/au/en/natoons&quot;&gt;New Giraffe toy&lt;/a&gt; from Kinder Egg!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Played &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Go&quot;&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/a&gt; after a few years of inactivity. Caught a 100iv &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamepress.gg/pokemongo/pokemon/390&quot;&gt;chimchar&lt;/a&gt; and shiny &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamepress.gg/pokemongo/pokemon/131&quot;&gt;lapras&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;third-week&quot;&gt;Third Week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Went to London, played tic-tac-toe variant with two people. Raining all day.&lt;/p&gt;
